# Experimental structure:

# To detect indirect effects of Pycnopodia on purple urchin feeding rates, the experiment
# tracked the consumption of kelp by urchins across 5 paired replicates with two treatments
# (exposed to Pycno, not exposed to Pycno) for between 51 and 69 hours. Urchins were
# held individually in small containers within one of two larger seawater tanks that either
# had 'Pycno smell' or not. Kelp was fed to the urchins as small standardized disks
# and consumption across the trial was calculated as the number of disks they ate between
# each time point at which they were checked (every six hours during daylight, twelve hours
# between next day). Values of disks consumed are transformed into biomass below in the 
# script based on weights of 'test disks' of kelp (i.e.: 1 disk = 0.341 g kelp tissue).

# Primary questions:

# Q1
# Did the urchins consume different amounts of kelp through time based on their treatment?

# Experimental structure:

# To detect indirect effects of Pycnopodia on purple urchin movement over short (i.e.:
# 1 hour) time scales and to determine if urchins will risk feeding depending on if
# they're well fed or starved, I ran an experiment testing various behaviors.
# Urchins were split into two groups, starved and fed, and held in those conditions
# (food withheld or given) for 7 weeks to precondition them for the experiment. 
# For the actual experiment I had two arenas (for convenience, identical) that I 
# would place an urchin into and watch for an hour. Like the previous experiment,
# one of the treatments was exposure to Pycnopodia water that was plumbed from a header
# tank into the center of the arena. There was also a no-Pycno control treatment.
# The other factors in the experiment were the starvation state of the particular urchin
# tested (fed, starved), and the presence or absence of a kelp cue in the middle of the
# tank next to the outflow from the header tank. This created a fully crossed design of 
# Pycno (present, absent), urchin (fed, starved), and kelp (present, absent). I would place
# the urchins in the tank and record their behavior every minute for an hour. The only
# behaviors I'm addressing here are movement (i.e.: how much time did they spend moving around
# versus sitting still), and how much time they spent 'interacting' with the cue 
# sources in the center of the tank (interacting, not interacting). For the purposes
# of the experiment, 'interacting' meant that the urchin had at least one tube foot 
# touching the kelp/kelp control, or the actual inflow from which the Pycno or control
# water was flowing from. 
#
# I also filmed all the trials with GoPro and used some software to extract xy coordinates
# set to a scale bar and calculate total distance moved by each urchin. 
#  
# The idea is that movement can be a proxy for 'escape response' and interaction with
# the signal (particularly in the treatments where kelp was present) can be a proxy
# for 'willingness to risk predation for food'.

# decrease in feeding = negative number). Convert 'time point' into the actual hours that
